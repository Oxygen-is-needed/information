This is, relatively, my declaration to learning C++, with my motivations my own,
and yours your own.


# Learning

To learning C++ in general, I promote finding at least *three* sources of
information. I usally break this down further by making sure there are *two*
different mediums. This provides coverage and different perspectives on the
learning topic, and (if needed, but should tried to be avoided) provide
repitition to lock information in.


## Motivation

![Just Do It](/just_do_it.png)

Motivation, the driving force behind what you do. It is hard to become motivated
to do things. How is it that it seems that some men can go on for many hours
doing very difficult tasks for, what seems, all day.

I think that the question is not how you can do all these diffictult tasks, but
I think the question should be instead, why not. What stop the human person from
doing what is for the benifit of himself? To sacrifce himself now, for a
superior future.

I could get physiological on you, but I am not qualified, and there are too many
questions for myself to fully proclame the correct method, or preach a path. I
too am looking down this path. Although I lack this, I still am one able to
observe: the trends, the patterns, of life.

This is what I find fixes the motivation issue: Just do it. This being
relatively the joke, however not completly false. Do just a little, strive to do
just 1% of what you want totally, some progress is better than none. Doing
something consistent help clear the way to a habbit.

If you find a path, the way to getting a project done, run with it, and try to
do it immediately. This will give you the motivation to do it. It does, however
do one bad for you: It promotes you starting a new project. Keep that in mind,
that you should try to finish the projects you start.

This could become an entire article, but its possible to learn this even if:


## Life

Life, may get in the way. If you have kids/family, social events/obligations,
etc, etc. This is where just showing up helps, and doing even the smallest
ammount of work.

You can track every single thing you need to do throughout the day, and you will
notice that you come up with plenty of time. This may not be news to you, but
know, even in the quiet hours, you can read that one page.


## Knowledge

I have felt that at somepoints that I have hit the limit of the accumalation of
knowledge for some time, and like a bucket with holes, it starts to leak. For
the most part, many people dont reach that limit.

Most likely the first limit people reach is that of sorting through the
available information, and even finding it. I will hope to sort latter to some
degree, the first will be an unavoidable neccessity in this world of ours.

Yet still most people now adays, do not venture to seeve through this sea of
information. So venture to do so.

Do take note, however, that staying in the realm of information does no good,
when it is not actively applied. This may be done through creating a project, or
conversing with others.

## Finding Methods

- [Google it (google dorking)](#google-dorking)
- [College Courses](#college-courses)

### Google Dorking

This method uses google to search for specific things, using "advanced search
operators". This does have some conotations of being used by hackers, but they
can be increadibly usful when searching for specific knowledge.

You really only need a couple of commands:

- `site:<site>` --  searches for text in site title.
- `inurl:<text>` -- searches for text in url.
- `filetype:<type>` -- searches for file type.
- `intext:<text>` -- searches for text in main body of page.
- `-` -- excludes text from search.
